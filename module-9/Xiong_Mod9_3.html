        <h2>Chapter 1: My Introduction</h2>
        <p class="intro">Hi my name is Hlee. In Hmong, my name translates to the <span id = "moon">______</span>. I live in a small <span id = "Texas">______</span> town one hour from Dallas. I was born and raised in California. My husband and I have a four-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Currently, I support Target's credit fraud prevention department. I've been with the department for two years and I see myself with Target for many years to come. I'm studying software development in hopes of becoming a Target software engineer. I have approximately one more year of school. </p>
        <p>I choose to study software development because I enjoy challenges and rewards. Learning programming languages like Java and Python are equally challenging, but I am confident in my learning capabilities. I would like to be challenged in a real-world scenario, such as developing programs for Target. </p>
        <p> Besides work and school, I enjoy spending <span id = "outdoor">______</span> time with my family. If the <span id = "weather">______</span> permits, we are usually out swimming and fishing.</p>
